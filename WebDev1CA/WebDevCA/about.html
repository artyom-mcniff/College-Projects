			<h2> The Site's Purpose </h2>
			<p>
			Bookwyrm is a site dedicated to celebrating the joy of reading books, as well as books in general. The website appeals to avid readers as well as those who have never picked up a book in their life. My mission is to further promote literature in the modern era. If you want to learn more, check out the blog for more information. If you're look for a good book to read, check out the recommended reading section.

			<h2> About the Site's Author </h2>
			<p>
			Artyom McNiffâ€™s my name, and I absolutely adore reading books. This site was created purely to share that love with the rest of the world. Obviously I have other hobbies, but reading trumps them all! While we are on the subject of books, let me tell you who my favourite author is. If you guessed Albert Camus, you would be one hundred percent correct! Ok, one last piece of information before I go, or well, five pieces of information. My top five favourite books!
