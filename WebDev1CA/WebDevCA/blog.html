			<h2> The Blog </h2>
				<p>
				This week’s blog post is about the author Albert Camus, one of the most important French writers of the 20th century.

			<h2> About the Author </h2>
				<p>
				Albert Camus was born in Algeria in 1913. His childhood was poor, although not unhappy. He was brought up in North Africa and had many jobs there (one of them playing in goal for the Algiers football team). He studied philosophy at the University of Algiers, and became a journalist as well as organizing the Theatre de l’equipe, a young avant-garde dramatic group. His early essays were collected in L’Envers et l’endroit (The Wrong Side and the Right Side) and Noces (Nuptials). He went to Paris, where he worked on the newspaper Paris Soir before returning to Algeria. His first two important books, L'Etranger (The Outsider) and the long essay Le Mythe de Sisyphe (The Myth of Sisyphus), were published when he returned to Paris. After the occupation of France by the Germans in 1941, Camus was a member of the Resistance. He contributed to the underground newspaper Combat, which he had helped to found. After the war he devoted himself to writing and established an international reputation with suchs books as La Peste (The Plague; 1947), Les Justes (The Just; 1949) and La Chute (The Fall; 1956) During the late 1950s Camus renewed his active interest in the theatre, writing and directing stage adaptations of William Faulkner’s Requiem for a Nun and Dostoyevsky’s The Possessed. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. He was killed in a road accident in 1960. His last novel, Le Premier Homme (The First Man), unfinished at the time of his death, appeared for the first time in 1994. An instant bestseller, the book received widespread critical acclaim, and has been translated and published in over thirty countries.
				Jean-Paul Satre paid tribute to him in his obituary notice: “Camus could never cease to be one of the principal forces in our cultural domain, nor to represent in his own way, the history of France and of this century.

			<section class="content">
			<h4> Plot Summary </h4>
				<p>
				The title character of The Outsider is Meursault, a Frenchman who lives in Algiers. The novel is famous for its first lines: “Mother died today. Or maybe it was yesterday, I don’t know.” After this introduction, the reader follows Meursault through the novel’s first-person narration to Marengo, where he sits vigil at the place of his mother’s death. Despite the expressions of grief around him during his mother’s funeral, Meursault does not show any outward signs of distress. This removed nature continues throughout all of Meursault’s relationships, both platonic and romantic.
				</p>
				<p>
				Raymond, an unsavoury friend, is eventually arrested for assaulting his mistress and asks Meursault to vouch for him to the police. Meursault agrees without emotion. Raymond soon encounters a group of men, including the brother of his mistress. The brother, referred to as “the Arab,” slashes Raymond with a knife after Raymond strikes the man repeatedly. Meursault happens upon the altercation and shoots the brother dead, not out of revenge but, he says, because of the disorienting heat and vexing brightness of the sun, which blinds him as it reflects off the brother’s knife. This murder is what separates the two parts of the story.
				</p>
				<p>
				The novel’s second part begins with Meursault’s pretrial questioning, which primarily focuses on the accused’s callousness toward his mother’s funeral and his murder of “the Arab.” His lack of remorse, combined with his lack of sadness expressed toward his mother, works against him and earns him the nickname “Monsieur Antichrist” from the examining magistrate. During the trial itself, Meursault’s character witnesses do more harm than good, because they highlight Meursault’s apparent apathy and disengagement. Eventually, Meursault is found guilty of murder with malice aforethought and is sentenced to death by guillotine. As he waits for his impending death, he obsesses over the possibility of his appeal being accepted. A chaplain visits Meursault against his wishes, only to be greeted by Meursault’s intense atheistic and nihilistic views. In a cathartic explosion of rage, Meursault brings the chaplain to tears. This, however, brings Meursault peace and helps him to accept his death with open arms.

			<h4> Analysis </h4>
			<p>
			Camus utilized The Stranger as a platform to explore absurdity, a concept central to his writings and at the core of his treatment of questions about the meaning of life. However, Camus did not identify himself as a philosopher. In fact, he abjured “armchair” philosophy and argued that sitting around and thinking was not enough. One needed to live life as well. He also did not identify himself as an existentialist. He agreed with some proponents of existentialist thought that life has no inherent meaning, but he criticized others for their pursuit of personal meaning. Camus’s concept of the absurd instead implored people to accept life’s lack of meaning and rebel by rejoicing in what life does offer. Elements of this philosophy can be seen in Meursault, as he refuses to behave as if there is meaning where there is none—or, as Camus himself put it in a preface to The Stranger, Meursault “does not play the game.” Society thus feels threatened and cuts off Meursault’s head. Similar themes can be seen in Camus’s essay Le Mythe de Sisyphe (The Myth of Sisyphus), also published in 1942. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Camus wrote The Stranger from a place of tragedy and suffering. His father had died in World War I, and the unfolding carnage of World War II forced a questioning of life and its meaning. Camus had also witnessed mistreatment of native Algerians during the French occupation of Algeria, which had begun in the first half of the 19th century and, after World War I, was opposed by a growing nationalist movement. This conflict can be seen specifically in Meursault’s killing of “the Arab,” the only name he uses to refer to Raymond’s mistress’s brother. The murder has been read by some as a metaphor for the treatment of Algerian Muslims by the colonizing French. Camus published The Stranger at a time when Algerians were demanding political autonomy with increased forcefulness; although France did extend some rights during the 1940s, ongoing conflicts and failed French promises of more independence culminated in the outbreak of the Algerian War in 1954.

			<h3> The Plague </h3>
			</section>
			
			
			<section class="content">
			<h4> Plot Summary </h4>
			<p>
			The Plague is a novel about a plague epidemic in the large Algerian city of Oran. In April, thousands of rats stagger into the open and die. When a mild hysteria grips the population, the newspapers begin clamoring for action. The authorities finally arrange for the daily collection and cremation of the rats. Soon thereafter, M. Michel, the concierge for the building where Dr. Rieux works, dies after falling ill with a strange fever. When a cluster of similar cases appears, Dr. Rieux's colleague, Castel, becomes certain that the illness is the bubonic plague. He and Dr. Rieux are forced to confront the indifference and denial of the authorities and other doctors in their attempts to urge quick, decisive action. Only after it becomes impossible to deny that a serious epidemic is ravaging Oran, do the authorities enact strict sanitation measures, placing the whole city under quarantine.
			</p>
			<p>
			The public reacts to their sudden imprisonment with intense longing for absent loved ones. They indulge in selfish personal distress, convinced that their pain is unique in comparison to common suffering. Father Paneloux delivers a stern sermon, declaring that the plague is God's punishment for Oran's sins. Raymond Rambert endeavors to escape Oran to rejoin his wife in Paris, but the city's bureaucrats refuse to let him leave. He tries to escape by illegal means with the help of Cottard's criminal associates. Meanwhile, Rieux, Tarrou, and Grand doggedly battle the death and suffering wrought by the plague. Rambert finalizes his escape plan, but, after Tarrou tells him that Rieux is likewise separated from his wife, Rambert is ashamed to flee. He chooses to stay behind and help fight the epidemic. Cottard committed a crime (which he does not name) in the past, so he has lived in constant fear of arrest and punishment. He greets the plague epidemic with open arms because he no longer feels alone in his fearful suffering. He accumulates a great deal of wealth as a smuggler during the epidemic.
			</p>
			<p>
			After the term of exile lasts several months, many of Oran's citizens lose their selfish obsession with personal suffering. They come to recognize the plague as a collective disaster that is everyone's concern. They confront their social responsibility and join the anti-plague efforts. When M. Othon's small son suffers a prolonged, excruciating death from the plague, Dr. Rieux shouts at Paneloux that he was an innocent victim. Paneloux, deeply shaken by the boy's death, delivers a second sermon that modifies the first. He declares that the inexplicable deaths of innocents force the Christian to choose between believing everything and believing nothing about God. When he falls ill, he refuses to consult a doctor, leaving his fate entirely in the hands of divine Providence. He dies clutching his crucifix, but the symptoms of his illness do not match those of the plague. Dr. Rieux records him as a "doubtful case."
			</p>
			<p>
			When the epidemic ends, Cottard cannot cope. He begins randomly firing his gun into the street until he is captured by the police. Grand, having recovered from a bout of plague, vows to make a fresh start in life. Tarrou dies just as the epidemic is waning, but he battles with all his strength for his life, just as he helped Rieux battle for the lives of others. Rambert's wife joins him in Oran after the city gates are finally opened, but Dr. Rieux's own wife dies of a prolonged illness before she and her husband can be reunited. The public quickly returns to its old routine, but Rieux knows that the battle against the plague is never over because the bacillus microbe can lie dormant for years. The Plague is his chronicle of the scene of human suffering that all too many people are willing to forget.
			</p>
			</section>
			
			
			<section class="content">
			<h4> Analysis </h4>
			<p>
			The central irony in The Plague lies in Camus' treatment of "freedom." The citizens of Oran become prisoners of the plague when their city falls under total quarantine, but it is questionable whether they were really "free" before the plague. Their lives were strictly regimented by an unconscious enslavement to their habits. Moreover, it is questionable whether they were really alive. It is only when they are separated by quarantine from their friends, lovers and families that they most intensively love them. Before, they simply took their loved ones for granted.
			</p>
			<p>
			Camus' philosophy is an amalgam of existentialism and humanism. An atheist, Camus did not believe that death, suffering, and human existence had any intrinsic moral or rational meaning. Because he did not believe in God or an afterlife, Camus held that human beings, as mortals, live under an inexplicable, irrational, completely absurd death sentence. Nevertheless, Camus did believe that people are capable of giving their lives meaning. The most meaningful action within the context of Camus' philosophy is to choose to fight death and suffering.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the early days of the epidemic, the citizens of Oran are indifferent to one another's suffering because each person is selfishly convinced that his or her pain is unique compared to "common" suffering. When the epidemic wears on for months, many of Oran's citizens rise above themselves by joining the anti-plague effort. The recognition of the plague as a collective concern allows them to break the gap of alienation that has characterized their existence. Thus, they give meaning to their lives because they chose to rebel against death. Fleeing the city or otherwise avoiding the anti-plague effort is tantamount to surrendering to the absurd death sentence under which every human being lives.
			</p>
			<p>
			Just as any rebellion against death and suffering is ultimately futile, so do the anti-plague efforts seem to make little difference in the relentless progress of the epidemic. However, Camus' novel declares that this rebellion is nonetheless a noble, meaningful struggle even if it means facing never-ending defeat. In this way, The Plague is infused with Camus' belief in the value of optimism in times of hopelessness. Everyone who chooses to fight the plague, to rebel against death, knows that their efforts increase their chances of contracting the plague, but they also realize they could contract the plague if they did nothing at all. In the face of such a seemingly meaningless choice, between death and death, the fact that they make a choice to act and fight for themselves and their community becomes even more meaningful; it is a note of defiance thrown against the wind, but that note is the only thing through which someone can define himself.

			<h3> The Fall </h3>
			</section>
			
			
			<section class="content">
			<h4> Plot Summary </h4>
			<p>
			The Fall is an extended monologue conducted over the course of five days by a man who calls himself Jean-Baptiste Clamence. The setting is Amsterdam, whose fogginess is miasmic and whose canals are likened to the concentric circles of hell. Like some infernal Ancient Mariner, the speaker attaches himself to a stranger who happens to wander into a raffish bar incongruously named Mexico City. A master of guile, Clamence deliberately piques the curiosity of his listener, who remains an unnamed “you.” Gradually, cunningly, he implicates him—and the reader—in his diabolical tale. Clamence infers that his auditor is a successful Parisian lawyer in his forties, and he tailors his story to appeal to and expose the weaknesses of the stranger. Clamence claims that he, too, used to live in Paris, where, as a widely respected magistrate, he exuded self-confidence. He then recounts an incident that forever undermined his certainties about personal worth.
			</p>
			<p>
			One November evening, walking across a bridge, he heard the cry of a woman who had thrown herself into the river. His reaction was to deny that he had heard anything and to continue walking. He remains, however, haunted by that dying cry and the fact that he evaded responsibility toward another human being.
			</p>
			<p>
			Written at a troubled time in Camus’s own life, The Fall is the bitter fictional tirade of a brilliant misanthrope who dismisses civilization with a mordant epigram: “A single sentence will suffice for modern man: he fornicated and read the papers.” Clamence admits that his name is a cunning alias. Like the biblical vox clamans in deserto, the narrator is a voice crying in the wilderness mocking specious hope for clemency toward universal guilt. “Every man testifies to the crime of all the others—that is my faith and my hope,” declares Clamence. It is also the rationale for his narrative, a strategy of confessing his culpability and coercing the listener—and reader—into acknowledging and sharing it.
			</p>
			<p>
			Duplicitous Clamence has assumed the function of what he calls “judge-penitent,” a deft way of being both condemner and condemned. He eventually lures his listener to his apartment, where he reveals a stolen Van Eyck on the wall. The reader’s knowledge of the purloined painting now implicates the reader, too, in the crime. The subject of the work, The Just Judges, reinforces the novel’s theme of judgement even as it mocks the possibility of justice. It is not merely perverse bravado that impels Clamence to entrust his felonious secret to a stranger; he realizes that in a world devoid of innocence, no one dare judge anyone else. Yet he dreams of being apprehended, of finding release from his personal burden by a stroke of the guillotine. Jean-Baptiste longs for the decapitation that was the fate of his namesake John the Baptist:I would be decapitated, for instance, and I’d have no more fear of death; I’d be saved. Above the gathered crowd, you would hold up my still warm head, so that they could recognize themselves in it and could again dominate—an exemplar. All would be consummated; I should have brought to a close, unseen and unknown, my career as a false prophet crying in the wilderness and refusing to come forth.
			</p>
			<p>
			Such redemption never comes. The Fall portrays all as trapped in a fallen world. Like Sisyphus, Clamence is condemned to repeat his futile gestures. Every time he encounters another listener (and reader), he is compelled anew to spread his gospel of universal guilt, to confirm it by his very success in persuading readers to share his story.

			<h4> Context and Analysis </h4>
			<p>
			In the early months of 1956, Albert Camus was physically and psychologically exhausted. In 1952, to the cynical amusement and the sceptical amazement of the savage, often irresponsible Parisian literary fauna, Camus had gone through a superb philosophical and political row over his essay, The Rebel, with Jean-Paul Sartre, then the literary guru of French intellectual life. Sartre always enjoyed a good fight, the next-best thing to world revolution. He emerged happy and boisterous from their clash in his monthly, Les Temps modernes. Not so Camus, who hated losing a friend. To Sartre, Camus had become a “bourgeois”; he had betrayed the working class by denouncing Stalinist communism. Worse still for Sarte who was trying to weld Existentialism and Marxism, Camus had also dared to criticize Marx’s theories.
			</p>
			<p>
			Born in an Algerian poor white family, Camus loved the sun, the light, the beaches, Saint-Augustin and his neo-Platonism. He felt he belonged to North Africa and entertained a lyrical, voluptuous vision of an ill-defined “Mediterranean civilization”. He believed that more than a hundred years after the conquest of Algeria, white settlers were entitled to live there, just as much as the Arabs and Kabyles were. In November 1954, Algerian nationalists decided that armed violence was the only way out of colonialism for the “natives”. To Camus’s horror, rebellion turned into a full-scale war with the French army. Half a million French conscripts were sent to fight a “dirty war”, relatively more than American GIs later sent to Vietnam. Camus was torn apart. When he was a journalist in Algiers in the thirties, he defended the Kabyles. He’d resigned from the Algerian Communist party because, on orders from Moscow, it soft-pedalled its anti-colonialist line. Camus did not. Up to a point, he understood Algerian nationalism. He could not accept the idea of Algerian independence though, and believed it would force poor whites, including his mother, into exile. He was also out of touch with the Arab world both in and outside North Africa.
			</p>
			<p>
			By the mid-fifties, Camus’s marriage to Francine Faure was on the rocks. Francine had attempted suicide: Camus told Roger Quilliot that he felt “responsible” but not “guilty”. Francine Faure’s nervous breakdown could not be attributed to his infidelities. There was a strong neurotic streak in the Faure family and, to make things worse, the Faures did not side with Camus over Algeria. They were much more “right-wing”.
			</p>
			<p>
			Camus had been involved in social and political problems in Algeria, in France during the German Occupation, the Resistance and through the heady days of the Liberation. However, he thought of himself first and foremost as a writer. Deep down, politics bored him. Above all Camus wanted to be a “creator of myths” as he put it, and an “artist”: this very word became the leitmotive of his 1957 Nobel prize acceptance speech.
			</p>
			<p>
			By his early twenties, Camus had become a craftsman of French prose. His family spoke very poor French. There wasn’t a single book at home during his childhood. The adolescent Albert Camus conquered the French language, the difficulties of its syntax, just as he had mastered the art of football.
			</p>
			<p>
			In The Fall, the hero, Jean-Baptise Clamence, laughs at his own immoderate love of the subjunctive, a laboured verbal mode. Camus, in real life and in his writings, could be pompous and starchy. Clamence never is, although he seems closer to the writer than any of the characters Camus had imagined. The book can feel ambiguous and may seem difficult to decipher. But whatever one’s first reactions, the fall benefits from several readings. It should be recognized as a subtle and bitter self-portrait of the mature man as an artist.
			</p>
			<p>
			Clamence complements Meursault: “The Outsider” was an outsider in society from the start. He was never rejected, except at the end of the novel when sentenced to death. Clamence, a barrister, part of the judiciary machine, opts out. Eventually he longs for spiritual death, joining Meursault. Clamence and Meursault are two sides of the same creative coin: both stand for Camus
			</p>
			<p>
			Clamence meditates on death with a grin. How we adore our friends, he says, once they’re gone! Why is it only then we are so nice about our loved ones? Perfectly simple; we no longer have any obligation to them. Camus remembered Sartre’s attacks on all those who ooze “bad faith”, people who produce marvellous excuses for their vilest actions and decided that his hero would be totally sincere, quite a daring gamble.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the fifties, when he was hounded, Camus also suffered from writer’s block, both the cause and effect of his solitude. When talking to his friend Robert Gallimard, he claimed, with a touch of melodrama, that he had nothing more to say. He was tired, depressed,a burnt-out case. All his life he’d had TB. Antibiotics, when he became ill at seventeen, did not exist. His illness induced periods of conscious or unconscious depression.
			</p>
			<p>
			Camus, in 1955 and 1956 felt a has been - if indeed, he wondered, he’d ever been anything. What had he done recently other than adapt some plays? To many people, friends and enemies alike, Camus often seemed haughty, aloof and pretentious. As his letters show, he was always, whether at twenty, thirty or forty, full of doubt and unsure of himself. 
			</p>
			<p>
			At that point, Camus decided to write some short stories. He was like a concert pianist who, while convalescing, would play short, easy pieces. Despondent, unaware of what he was doing, not realizing what his imagination and talent had in store for himself and his readers, Camus produced The Fall. He toiled hard at it: two manuscripts and several corrected typewritten versions survived, and other were destroyed. The sketchy short story developed into a profound, longer narrative, not quite a novel. Rather, a recit, a work of prose that cannot be pigeon-holed by text-books. For weeks, Camus was uncertain about its title. Should it be “The Shriek”? A cry of pain, a subdued lamento, is always present, even beneath the jokes and quirks. Why not “A hero of our times” or “A puritan for our time”? Camus wanted to show the confusion in the waste land of our age, a tragic and comic mid century reflected in the bizarre predicament of a lawyer presenting himself as a “judge-penitent”. Since Clamence preaches and pleads quite a bit, perhaps “The Good Apostle” could also provide a suitable title? Never before had Camus been so hesitant.
			</p>
			<p>
			His recent work on plays helped him: The Fall is a monologue with theatrical ingredients, including humour, often with a touch of eighteenth century wit. Camus rapturously condemns himself. He is the accused, his own prosecutor and advocate. The fall might have been called “The Last Judgement”.
			</p>
			<p>
			“The Mirror” was rejected as a dull, too obvious label. Finally, the respected writer Roger Martin du Gard, who liked Camus, suggested “The Fall”. It pointed to an actual fall, the physical drop of one main, absentee, character in the story, the woman, and to the moral descent of another, Clamence. A descent in a quasi-religious sense. Camus was always trying to answer a question handed over to twentieth century French novelists, including Andre Malraux, by their Russian nineteenth century colleagues: what can one do, what should we do with our soul if God does not exist? And indeed if He doesn’t, does anything go? The problem, if it is one, may be put another way: the Gospels provided a foundation for a moral system, solid rules, if one has faith. If God disappears from our view of life, on what do we build this moral code? Does any code hold?
			</p>
			<p>
			Many Catholic theologians have tried to turn Camus into a thinker on the verge of belief, ready for another baptism. Talking about God does not imply that one is with or near God. Francois Mauric - a practising catholic novelist and a literary institution - clearly saw that to be an acceptable believer, Camus lacked the “necessary feeling that God was judging us”. Lawyer, judge and penitent, Clamence stands in front of his self-appointed lay tribunal. Indeed, he compares the concentric Amsterdam canals to Hell, and this device is an interesting artifice, a neat efficient trick. Paradise and Hell, to Camus, anre here, on this earth. Some critics have also asserted that psychological self-flagellation, a device used by Camus, was Christian. Is it specifically Christian?
			</p>
			<p>
			Another friend of Camus’s Andre Ballamich argued against the very word “Fall”. People, he said, would talk about Camus’s fall and downfall, in every sense, psychological or political. Camus felt sure readers would understand though. He was over-sensitive to criticism but on issue he felt strongly about, he rarely caved in. So “the fall” it was.
			</p>
			<p>
			Today, polemics have died away. The commnuist world and its ideology have crumbled. Only the bamboo wall remains in China, North Korea, Laos, Vietnam and Cuba. Political correctness is on its way out, hopefully. But during the ideologically barbarous French fifties, in distinguished left-wing, liberal, circles (which were anything but liberal in their dogmatic intolerance), Camus, a double sinner in myopic eyes, was branded as “reactionary” for two damning reasons. Firstly, because he had become anti-communist and secondly because he did not ally himself with the nationalists of the Algerian Front de Liberation National (FLN). He probably thought the FLN was totalitarian. In short, until his death, Camus was ostracized, proclaimed a traitor to progressivism and history.
			</p>
			<p>
			So, he took refuge in writing and, with The Fall, in a new kind of stylistic exercise. To him, writing was the Exile and the Kingdom, the sickness and the cure. His initial refusal to acknowledge his own achievement with this peculiar and original “short story” stemmed partly from its sheer oddity. Having toiled through his first drafts he could not perceive a form he had never used and the unusual tone that hit his first readers. Camus had confessed to Noel Schumann “I can’t write anymore. I’m imprisoned by my form” How does a writer escape from the prison of format and style? By finding another style. “So that’s how impotent you were!” exclaimed Robert Gallimard when he went through the manuscript of The Fall. He and others were struck both by the subject-matter and the form.
			</p>
			<p>
			Camus decided to bring out The Fall on its own as a separate book, not with other stories. A first edition with a print-run of 16,500 copies went on sale on May 16th  1956, two days before sixteen French conscripts were kill in Algeria, near Palestro, by FLN guerillas. This spoilt Camus’s pleasure at bringing out a new book. It did very well even before the critics took it up. By November, 126,500 copies had been sold. Camus’s work always did well commercially, despite the clamour of his ferocious critics over the years. With the public, French and foreign, Camus was never out of favour except with some sections of the intelligentsia. In works like The Fall, sixth formers and PhD graduates, workers and intellectuals alike sensed, beyond the talent, a moving sincerity and honesty and an almost frightening universality. There was also in Camus’s approach to contemporary problems in the down-to-earth common sense lacking in so many continental rationalists with their taste for theories that discard unpleasant facts.
			</p>
			<p>
			On the back cover of The Fall, Camus clamped a sharp blurb, he was not, definitely not, Jean-Baptiste Clamence. He repeated this menacing assertion in interviews, so much that it should have made commentators suspicious. He wanted to protect himself and his family. He also felt that the story went far beyond biography masquerading as fiction. Quite a few scholars and critics have bought the “I’m-not-Clamence-line”, and with gusto, since many professed in the following years that the life and works of a writer were not linked in a manner that really mattered. Neo-structuralism and post-modernism looked almost exclusively at the “text” the “intertext” and assorted “epitexts” detached from the biographical and historical context. Down with Sainte-Beuve and up with Proust! The life, joys, pains, all the events and incidents of a creator's life were nothing compare to his adventures with language. An artistic achievement is always more than the mere chronicle of a writer’s life. Often it is also  his existence, remoulded and transcended by his use of language.
			</p>
			<p>
			Camus was never so lucidly and overtly autobiographical: Clamence is a bachelor - unlike Camus - residing in Amsterdam, where the writer spent barely four days. Clamence, like Camus, leaves his car doors unlocked and loves sport, particularly football. Small details. More meaningful though: Clamence makes it clear that he was not a member of the Resistance. Camus was. Clamence talks about his military service. Camus tried to enlist several times in 1940 but was rejected for health reasons. So the writer could make it clear that he was very definitely not Clamence!
			</p>
			<p>
			Clamence stands in the dock. In a series of crisp monologues, with clarity induced by plenty of Dutch gin, he holds forth on friendship, love, sensuality, guilt, innocence, justice, falsehood, rhetoric, all the topics that preoccupied Camus on and off. But he had never dealt with them in such a caustic mood. Superbly constructed as a long speech, The Fall is often successfully staged as a one man play lasting about eighty minutes. It requires a minimum of stage props, a chair, a small table, a glass, a bottle. The slightly shortened version edited by Catherine Camus, the author’s daughter, is extremely effective. The poignant narrative comes out forcefully as a play. Until now, The Stranger and The Plague have been hacked into terrible films or plays.
			</p>
			<p>
			The reader learns quickly that Jean-Baptiste Clamence walking late at night across the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris heard someone crying for help. Not far from him, a woman had thrown herself into the river Seine and most probably drowned. Clamence, this worthy hero of “our times”, didn’t move. How often have we moved when our friends and lovers or others needed us? When wars and massacres were breaking out and spreading, around us, near and far, in Europe and on other continents? We did move: we signed petitions, perhaps we took part in a public meeting or, more comfortably, in a radio discussion. “Modern man”, Clamence/Camus  sums up “fornicates and reads the papers”. Almost half a century later modern man still fornicates and watches Netflix. Is that an improvement?

			Clamence is not murderer. He has a ready explanation for not acting. We always have. At most, under French law, Clamence could be accused of “not helping a person in danger”. This scene of the unknown woman throwing herself into the Seine, the starting point of the book, is a symbolic transposition of Francine’s attempted suicides, of all men and women Camus didn’t help or forgot, of all out evasions, hypocrisies and betrayals. “You owe me this book” Francine smilingly said to Albert Camus when she read The Fall”. She added that it was high time the writer put himself on the rack.

			<p>
			At one point Clamence introduces himself as a comedian, an actor: with an unlimited professional right to lie, he nevertheless tries to tell the truth about himself and the universe to an imaginary companion, in the Amsterdam bar and along the city canals. We never know when he is telling the truth. The imaginary second character never talks. He is one of the “mirrors” in which Camus/Clamence looks at himself and at us. He stands for Camus’s moral conscience. Camus is so agile with words that in the reading process we become Jean-Baptiste’s accomplices. Meursault in The Outsider remains distant. Clamence is smarter, more brilliant, a first class rake, but warm. He is so lacking in self-pity that he gets all our sympathy. Yet as we get closer to him, he recedes into the bar smoke and the canal fog. He is like the horizon: we can never touch him. The reader never quite gets to the bottom of Clamence who tries hard to analyse himself. Guilty, not guilty? Clamence is very French: often what he says is less important than the way he puts it. In his Dostoyevskian diary, Camus jotted down some morse, self-searching remarks. “I’m interested in great souls. I’m not a great soul.” Nor is Clamence.
			</p>
			<p>
			Through his main character Camus describes, understands and eventually condemns many French intellectuals of the mid century, stuffed with vanity and ignorance, They declare their all-embracing love for humanity, but care little for individual human beings. Sartre had asserted that “Existentialism was a Humanism”. Clamence, at times half Sartre, half Camus, loves humanity and, sometimes, widows and orphans - if the public can see him defending them. A born-again Marxist, true to Lenin here Sartre wanted to make people happy against their will. All this comes out in The Fall.
			</p>
			<p>
			Camus transforms Clamence into an attractive, sentimental representative of the radical and chic left-wing. After the Liberation, Camus belonged to this group. He was, quite wrongly, classified and ossified as an atheist existentialist, second to Sartre. Clamence is also a smart do-gooder and a noisy busy-body - or was. In Paris, he ostentatiously helped the blind to cross streets. Did those who fought in cafes for the independence of Algeria or to defend the proletariat, take up their generous positions because political correctness was already its own reward? “In philosophy and politics”, says Clamence, “I’m in favour of any theory that refuses to recognize the innocence of man and in favour of any practice that take him to be guilty. In the old days, I spoke of freedom all the time. I’d butter my breakfast bread with it”. This is an unquestionably a sharp caricature of Sartrean ethics. There is always some truth in a good caricature. Camus is very tough on Sartre, who knew he was a genius and yet pretended to be like any other man. This irritated Camus, partly because it was true, partly because Sartre assumed the genius role with bitchy modesty. Camus makes Clamence/Sartre coo: “After being a man with such fullness and simplicity, I found myself to be a superman.” Camus, a man of nostalgia, always regretted his lost friendship with Sartre.
			</p>
			<p>
			Camus longed for Algeria: in Amsterdam Clamence is drunk on being homesick for Paris. Camus put up with Paris where he made a name for himself as novelist, dramatist, essayist and columnist. He came to hate the city, especially when friend and colleagues savaged him. To many inhabitants of the parisian literary hot-house, Camus seemed too gifted, too successful, even too handsome.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Fall contains many sexual and erotic symbols from the judeo-christian tradition. Over women, Clamence is hard with Camus - and tolerant. When he wrote The Fall, there were at least three important women in the writer's life and a few affairs. The novelist was a charmer. So is the fictional lawyer. But what is charm for Don Juan, Casanova, indeed for most womanizers? Camus nails it for Clamence and himself: charm, he suggests is a way of getting an answer in the affirmative without having put a clear question. This was a technique that came naturally to the young, gifted and famous Camus, raming cafes and bars around Saint-Germain-des Pres and Montparnasse, walking around newspaper offices on the Right bank or publishing houses on the Left bank. Clamence admits that for a ten minute encounter with a pretty crowd artist he would more than willingly give up ten discussions with Einstein. That was often the case with Camus. So, colleagues less gifted and less victorious than him in that field had yet another reason to hate him: competition among Paris literati was not limited to controversies about Marx, Hegel, the gulag or algeria. In Amsterdam, Clamence is not on the warpath to find girls. He reminisces about his Parisian ladies.
			</p>
			<p>
			Racing along a verbal labyrinth, the narrator peels away his masks, puts on new ones, both tragic and comic, as we all do. Reading The Fall, as Brian Fitch pointed out, is to incriminate oneself.
			</p>
			<p>
			Within the framework of a novella-play, Clamence, like Camus and the reader, is his own director, actor and audience. Camus, bickering with the Sartreans, discovered that many people disliked or even loathed him. He wondered not what had gone wrong around him, but where  he had slipped up. His semi-confession is also a purification rite. He eventually emerges from its ashes, like an innocent from confession or like a patient from a revealing session with his analyst. Camus/Clamence is absolved twice: once by himself because dissects his faults, errors, all his questionable actions, his egotism and his nihilistic temptations; and a second time because pain is transmuted into a work of art. Camus has travelled over the vast continent of cynicism but comes out of his various trips merely sceptical. Considering how depressive he was before starting to write The Fall, that was quite a feat. His next highly autobiographical work of fiction, The First Man, published posthumously, is often optimistic, even when it comes to Algeria. Some scene suggest that “natives” and “settlers” might get along some day. Much of Camus’s anguish and anxiety was dried up by The Fall. After its publication, Camus appeared to be intellectually, morally and artistically a different man: he had, up to a point, redeemed himself in his own eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
			A few critics have rejected the content of The Fall on the ground that it was often obscure, self-serving or convoluted. Indeed it sometimes is. So is life, frequently. Even the less sympathetic commentators have never denied the rare quality and beauty of the book’s style.
			</p>
			<p>
			In his fiction, unlike many great writers he admired, Faulkner or Roger Martin du Gard, Camus does not have one tone or the same style. The Outsider was all bursts of energy, short sentences, like machine-gun fire. The Plague is more classical, somewhat old-fashioned. The Fall is aphoristic. The narrative is an extraordinary technical achievement, an implicit dialogue with Clamence talking to someone who never appears, never talks. The implicit character echoes in our memory: he is also the reader, as if Clamence the actor came down to engage spectators, row after row.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Fall is Camus’s testament in middle age. It sketches a scintillating clinical picture of the dreary fifties. The writer expresses his discontent with himself and with western civilization. Along the way, he purges himself but not the world. He avoids preaching. He offers a diagnosis but does not hand out prescriptions. Here, Camus and Clamence separate. They are not identical twins, only brothers. Camus carries on. Clamence pines for prison at least, if not for death.
			</p>
			<p>
			With formidable determination, in his early twenties, Camus had mapped out his work: he would,, he had decided, write “cycles”. Each one would contain, a novel, a play, and an essay. The cycle of the Absurd involved The Outsider, Caligula, and The Myth of Sisyphus. Another cycle, Revolt, included,, The Plague, several plays and The Rebel, the main alleged cause of Camus’s brawl with Sartre. The First Man was to be at least a two volume saga of a much happier cycle. Camus died in an “absurd” car accident in 1960, whie working on this book. By then he had found a serenity and an inner equilibrium which he had not enjoyed for years.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Fall was never planned like The Outsider, The Plague, or The First Man. It was not part of a would-be philosophical construction. Camus was carried away by it: hence its spontaneity and depth, its elusive chiaroscuro. Camus had not entirely identified that book, a strange object that could not be set in his usual triptych arrangement. In some happy ways, it got the better of him. He went further than he had expected. He was pulled or pushed by inspiration as never before. His solitude had paid high creative dividends. Alone, he faced himself and the world around him, communism and Algeria. The book, by accident, is a novel, a play and an essay, a cycle on its own. Totalitarianism, “slavery”, is sarcastically praised by the delightful lawyer, better to be rejected. That also allowed Camus to claim he was not Clamence, the man who extolled nihilism. Did Camus, ever? No, of course not. So, argued Camus, once more I’m not Clamence. A deceptive pirouette in the Clamence style.
			</p>
			<p>
			When asked what his favourite book by Camus was, Jean-Paul Sartre replied. “The Fall”. When asked why, he replied “because Camus put himself and hid himself entirely in that work.”
			</p>
			<p>
			From 1952 to 1960, Sartre and Camus could not stand each other, yet had they ever been closer to understanding how the other’s mind worked, closer to appreciating the other’s work as an artist? Philosophically and politically they were - and still are, often with the excessive help of their devotees - poles apart. Psychologically they were neighbours in the same street, Introspection Alley. Both steered admirably between complacency and exhibitionism. To Sartre, The Fall was “authentic”, his ultimate compliment: The Fall was not bourgeois! Camus, Sartre felt, torched his bad faith away, certainly as a writer. Simone de Beauvoir disagreed. She had once been too much under Camus’s charm to accept Clamence.
			</p>
			<p>
			Camus is always cruel about himself in The Fall. Sartre is not in Words which he would not have written, I’m sure, if Camus had not published The Fall. Sartre lets himself off with dialectical fireworks. Camus probed deeper. Up to 1960, Camus was reversing his pessimism. Sartre until he died, cheerful and almost blind, in 1981, remained more optimistic about himself and the universe.
			</p>
			<p>
			Today, any reader, aware or not of those prehistoric political petty skirmishes between two writer, can admire and enjoy them both, esthetically, in and outside The Fall.
